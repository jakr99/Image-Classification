# Animal Kingdom Classification using CNN

This small project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images by kingdom (e.g., Animalia, Plantae, Fungi). The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset of labeled images, and it can predict the kingdom of new images.

## Project Structure
- **data_preprocessing.py** - Contains functions for loading and preprocessing the dataset.
- **model_building.py** - Defines and compiles the CNN model architecture.
- **train_model.py** - Trains the model on the training set and saves the trained model.
- **evaluate_model.py** - Loads the saved model, evaluates its performance, and displays metrics.
- **predict_single_image.py** - Loads the model and makes predictions on new images
